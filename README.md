# HungerFree

According to the United Nations Development Programme, about 40% of the food produced in India is wasted. Even though the food produced in India is adequate, the UN has reported that about 190 million of the Indian population remain undernourished. It is further estimated that the value of food wastage in India is around ₹92,000 crores per annum. These are some bleak statistics, but they should help us realize the magnitude of the problem of food waste, as much as inequity, in India. It has also been recognized that no truly sustainable and developed country can exist without tackling the issue of food waste and some steps need to be taken sooner. 


Hence, we thought of an initiative ‘HungerFree’ that would help this world to be a little better place to be in or to live in. HungerFree connects hotels, restaurants, wedding planners and party planners with customers & NGOs who then distribute this food among the people in need. HungerFree also provides a comprehensive analysis for hotels and restaurants.
