      in the world go to the bed hungry every day, based on an estimated world
      population of 7.6 Billion.

        However, for people who are not even able to eat one meal a day, often
        wonder if all the food that is being wasted around them on a daily basis
        could have filled their stomach.

    <h2><strong>Share Food</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Why is it that some people have so much
        food that it goes to waste, and why is it that
        some people have to go to bed without even
        being able to have a meal per day? It's high time
        when we start thinking about those unpriviledged people and help them.
